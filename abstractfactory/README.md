# Abstract Factory Design Pattern
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
## Pros and Cons
### Pros
You can be sure that the products youâ€™re getting from a factory are compatible with each other.<br>
You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code. <br>
Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier to support. <br>
Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.<br>

### Cons
The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.<br>
